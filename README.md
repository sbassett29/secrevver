# secrevver

A fun little tool to randomly choose who will perform the next security review if all other methods break down.  It can also be used for any similar scenario when all methods of selecting resources or making decisions have been exhausted.

## Prerequisites

```
A web server or local filesystem that can run browser html and javascript
```

## Installing

1. ```git clone https://github.com/sbassett29/secrevver.git```
2. Move files to a web server that can serve html and javascript.  Or move files to your filesystem and open ```index.html``` in a browser.
3. Configure names within the ```container``` div within ```index.html``` 

## Usage

There is a green-ish button that says "Let us find out..."  Click it.  If desired results are not achieved, click it again (this time the button will say "Let us try again!")

## Known Issues
